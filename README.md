# 🕵️ Packet Sniffer Analysis and Metrics Extraction

## 📌 Overview
This project involves modifying a functional packet sniffer to analyze network traffic and extract key metrics. It includes:

- Capturing and replaying network traffic using **tcpreplay**.
- Extracting various **network metrics** from `.pcap` files.
- Generating **visualizations** and **statistical data** from the captured packets.
- Measuring **network speed performance** under different configurations.
